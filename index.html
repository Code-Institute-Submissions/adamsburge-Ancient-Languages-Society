            <p>In 1998, John Faroe, Nigel Horrocks and Jennifer Wasche started an ancient languages reading and conversation group to help them better understand the languages they were studying in university. The reading group aided their understanding of the languages so much that they decided to share their method with others. And thus the Ancient Languages Society was born.</p>
            <p>Now, spread over three cities in the UK and Ireland, we offer instruction in several ancient languages, in small class sizes of no more than 8 students. We also offer weekly in-person meet-ups where individuals can practise various languages through active conversation and group readings of relevant texts.</p>
            <p>All of our teachers are experts and have obtained PhDâ€™s in their respective fields. As the aim of ALS is to preserve the knowledge of ancient languages, our classes are free of charge to any student who wishes to study with us. This is made possible by the generous support of the Dorothy Rainer foundation.</p>

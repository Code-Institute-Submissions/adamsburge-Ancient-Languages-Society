# The Ancient Languages Society

Welcome to the Ancient Language Society. This is a website created for the HTML and CSS Essentials Portfolio Project with [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net). The Ancient Languages Society and all of the mentioned individuals and establishments on the website are fictional and were created for the purpose of the Code Institute Project.

You can view the website [here](https://adamsburge.github.io/Ancient-Languages-Society/).

The website is mobile responsive, as can be seen in the image below.

# Features

The website is a single-page site with a menu that takes the user to different sections of the page. There are six total sections: Home (or landing section), About Us, Teaching, Teachers, Events, and a Signup Form. Each section is designed to take up the entire view height of the screen on desktops. This feature is removed on mobile formats.

## Home Section

- The home/landing section provides a simple title page layout with the name of the society, the locations it operates in, and an image of a fresco from Pompeii.
<br><br>

## About Us Section

- The About Us section provides a brief history of the society and how it began and sets it beside (or under on mobile) an old sketch of a group of people reading together (a fitting image since the society hosts reading groups).
<br><br>

## Teaching Section

# Testing



## Bugs

- One unsolved bug is that the mobile hamburger drop-down menu has to be manually closed. This, however, is due to the fact that I decided not to use Javascript as this project is focused on HTML and CSS. I intentionally tried to find a way to create the mobile menu without using Javascript and this is the one bug. This feature could be fixed in the future if I decide to incorporate Javascript.

## Validator Testing

- HTML - The HTML was tested with [the W3C HTML validator service](https://validator.w3.org)
    - The HTML did not have any errors, but the service did mention a few warnings. 
        - Warning 1: to only use H1 headings as top-level headings. Yet, as this is a single page site, the sections act as pages. Thus each section has a H1 Heading, but all other heading are H2 and below.
        - Warning 2: lists an empty heading. However, this heading is not empty, but contains a submit input and the heading is used to style the button.

- CSS - The CSS was tested with [the W3C CSS validator service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and no errors were found.

- Accesibility (Lighthouse score):
